          <p>
            <span>Kamagasaki</span> has been a place name since 1922. An
            accurate count of occupants has never been produced, even in the
            national census, due to the large population of day laborers who
            lack permanent addresses.
          </p>

          <p>
            Daily life in Kamagasaki in the 1950s was photographed
            by SeiryūInoue, who won the 1961 Newcomer's Prize awarded by the
            Japan Photography Critics` Society for "One Hundred Faces of
            Kamagasaki". It has the largest day laborer concentration in the
            country.
          </p>

          <p>
            30,000 people are estimated to live in every 2,000 meter radius in
            this area, part of which has been in slum-like conditions until as
            recently as 2012, containing run-down housing structures and
            untidystreets.

            The area surrounding Kamagasaki is upscale, clean and attracts
            tourists with popular sightseeing spots including
            the Tsutenkaku, Shinsekai, and Nipponbashi.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, in Kamagasaki, homeless people can often be seen sleeping
            in the streets throughout the day, and
            <span class="doya">"doya"</span> hotels (cheap temporary rooms
            intended for day laborers) abound in the area.
          </p>

          <p>
            Non-profit and religious organizations frequently give out food
            rations, creating long lines of people in public parks. Property
            values in Kamagasaki are noticeably lower than those of surrounding
            areas.

            Day laborer gathers every single night at bars grabbing the money
            they just earned on the day. Just stop by one or two bars and you
            will be learning a lot of life lessons: day laborer love talking and
            they often start off telling you about their life history.
          </p>

          <p>
            The city government of Osaka does not allow the name "Kamagasaki" to
            appear on official maps and discourages the use of the name in the
            media. A film set in the neighborhood by director Shingo Ota which
            was partially financed by the city, called "Fragile", was pulled
            from the 2013-2014 Osaka Asian Film Festival after Ota refused to
            cut scenes from the film that identified the location of the
            community and referenced certain aspects of its culture.
          </p>

          <p>
            Kamagasaki is not only just a lower town but also the place that
            gives you a full of energy.
